Breaking free from digital addiction requires a structured approach that acknowledges both the spiritual and neurological aspects of recovery. This 30-day plan combines Islamic principles with modern behavioral science to guide you through a transformative month of healing.

### Before You Begin

- **Set your intention (niyyah)** clearly – recovery is both a spiritual and physical journey
- **Choose the right time** to start when you have fewer external pressures
- **Inform close friends and family** so they can support your journey
- **Download screen time tracking apps** to measure your progress objectively

### Phase 1: Days 1-10 — Awareness & Reduction

#### Day 1-3: Assessment & Intention
- Take a complete digital inventory (which apps/sites consume most time)
- Set specific, measurable goals for reduction (e.g., "Reduce social media from 3 hours to 1 hour daily")
- Establish baseline measurements using screen time tracking
- Create a written contract with yourself including your "why"

#### Day 4-7: Creating Friction
- Delete non-essential apps from your phone (you can reinstall after 30 days if truly needed)
- Enable grayscale mode on your devices to reduce dopamine triggers
- Set up app timers and downtime settings
- Move social apps off your home screen, requiring at least 3 clicks to access them

#### Day 8-10: Establishing Alternatives
- Create a list of high-quality substitute activities (reading, exercise, creative pursuits)
- Schedule specific times for device use rather than constant access
- Implement the "Quran before social" rule – read at least 5 verses before any recreational screen time
- Begin a daily journal documenting triggers, feelings, and successes

### Phase 2: Days 11-20 — Detox & Rewiring

#### Day 11-13: Digital Sabbath
- Implement a 24-hour complete digital fast (except for essential communication)
- Notice withdrawal symptoms without judgment
- Increase physical activity to naturally boost dopamine levels
- Reconnect with prayer with full presence (khushu)

#### Day 14-17: Rebuilding Neural Pathways
- Implement the 20-minute rule: wait 20 minutes when feeling urges
- Practice mindfulness meditation for 10 minutes when experiencing cravings
- Begin a hobby that requires focused attention and creates flow states
- Increase in-person social connections

#### Day 18-20: Strengthening Your Foundation
- Create physical boundaries (charging devices outside bedroom, tech-free zones)
- Establish pre-sleep rituals without screens (at least 1 hour before bed)
- Implement content boundaries (which topics/creators truly benefit you?)
- Review and celebrate progress so far

### Phase 3: Days 21-30 — Sustainable Transformation

#### Day 21-24: Deepening Spiritual Connection
- Start or deepen a daily Quran practice (with tadabbur/reflection)
- Implement dhikr (remembrance) when reaching for devices out of habit
- Connect device reduction with increased worship
- Find an accountability partner for both spiritual and digital goals

#### Day 25-27: Identity Shift
- Begin seeing yourself as someone who controls technology rather than being controlled by it
- Write a new personal narrative about your relationship with digital media
- Contribute positively online instead of just consuming content
- Share what you've learned with one person who might benefit

#### Day 28-30: Future-Proofing Your Recovery
- Develop your personalized "digital nutrition" plan (which digital consumption truly nourishes you)
- Create a relapse prevention strategy for high-stress periods
- Document lessons learned and changes experienced
- Set intentions for your digital life moving forward

### What to Expect During Recovery

- **Days 1-3**: Heightened awareness of habits, possible anxiety
- **Days 4-10**: Initial withdrawal symptoms (irritability, boredom, FOMO)
- **Days 11-20**: Growing sense of mental clarity, improved attention span
- **Days 21-30**: New habits becoming automatic, increased sense of agency

### Islamic Principles Supporting Recovery

Throughout this journey, draw strength from these spiritual foundations:

- **Muraqabah**: Self-observation and vigilance regarding your actions
- **Muhasabah**: Daily self-accounting and reflection
- **Sabr**: Patience through difficulty with hope in Allah's reward
- **Tawakkul**: Trust in Allah while taking necessary actions
- **Shukr**: Gratitude for progress and blessings along the way

Remember the Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ guidance: "The strong person is not the one who overcomes people, but the one who overcomes his nafs (self)."
